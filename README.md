# What can I make with code?

You can make many things, like:
* A game (2D/3D)
* Android UI/software
* Bots
* ML/AI 
* Websites

and much, much more.

# What should I learn?

* If you wanna make something Minecraft related, it's best to learn [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)).
* If you wanna make a Discord bot, learn [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and/or [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
* If you wanna make websites, have a clear understanding about [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), and [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). Then, get into a framework like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/) (Note: There are other frameworks too, but these are the most popular and the most preffered frameworks)
* If you wanna make machine learning stuff, learn [Python](https://www.python.org/).
* If you wanna make Android related software, learn [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).
* If you wanna make a game, learn C++ along with [Unity](https://unity.com/) or [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/).

# How do I start?

Have you chosen what you wanna do? If yes, then first, **learn a tutorial or take up a course for it.** Then, choose a [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), and install the prerequisites for that particular knowledge.
