# What can I make with code?

You can make many things, like:
* A game (2D/3D)
* Android UI/software
* Bots
* ML/AI 
* Websites
and much, much more.

# What should I learn?

* If you wanna make something Minecraft related, it's best to learn Java.
* If you wanna make a Discord bot, learn JavaScript and/or TypeScript.
* If you wanna make websites, have a clear understanding about HTML, CSS, and JS. Then, get into a framework like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/) (Note: There are other frameworks too, but these are the most popular and the most preffered frameworks)
* If you wanna make machine learning stuff, learn Python.
* If you wanna make Android related software, learn Kotlin.
* If you wanna make a game, learn C++ along with Unity or Unreal Engine.

# How do I start?

Have you chosen what you wanna do? If yes, then first, **learn a tutorial or take up a course for it.** Then, choose a [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), and install the prerequisites for that particular knowledge.
